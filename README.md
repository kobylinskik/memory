# memory

A memory game which I started some time ago. It had many more stages/commits, but I'm uploading only the last one because I wasn't 100% certain whether the content I had used was within fair use of copyrighted material; I didn't worry about it when I kept it only on my computer, but I do when I upload the content.

There are two game modes available: one is "easy" and any uncovered pair remains uncovered; the other one is "hard" and if you make a mistake, all cards cover, so you must remember all cards' positions and uncover them all in one try to win the game!

You can also choose the background image from the menu if you wish :)
